Project title: Automated Diagnosis and Classification of Coffee Leaf Diseases Using Deep Learning
Problem
Farmers face significant challenges in the early detection and management of diseases affecting coffee plants. Late identification of diseases often results in substantial crop loss, negatively impacting the income and livelihoods of farmers. This situation exacerbates poverty, contributes to food insecurity, and may lead to the use of excessive and inappropriate pesticides, posing risks to human health and the environment.
Solution
The Automated Diagnosis and Classification of Coffee Plant Diseases Using Deep Learning project addresses the aforementioned problem by developing a mobile application. The application utilizes a trained deep learning model and a camera to enable farmers to detect diseases in their coffee crops early on, the app suggests specific cure tailored to the identified diseases, promoting targeted and responsible pesticide use and the symptoms of different disease detected This empowers farmers to take timely and appropriate measures to prevent the spread of diseases and minimize crop loss.
Our project is using coffee plant leaf images (data) and deep learning techniques to diagnose and classify coffee plant diseases. The deep learning will be saved as a persistent model and saved on to the disk for automation. The persistent model will then be incorporated with a JavaScript framework or library so that our users will be able to interact with the model with little or no assistance. When farmers upload the picture of a coffee plant leaf into the web application or use the Android app on their phone and take picture of the coffee plant, the deep learning model should be able to give them feedback with regards to the health of the coffee plant. In this project, we do not intend to go to the field and collect data due to time factor. Instead, we shall make use of secondary data from platforms like Kaggle. In the automation process for the frontend, we built a mobile application for our users. This project will aid mitigate economic loss to coffee farmers due to the various diseases that can occur to coffee plants. The wastage of coffee plants due to diseases will also be reduced greatly as the project will aid in the early identification and proper classification of coffee diseases.

Increased Confidence: Farmers can make informed decisions on disease management, leading to increased confidence in their farming practices
Our Competitors
Several efforts have been made using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist farmers to correctly identify the diseases and pests that affect their production and the severity of the symptoms. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems allow any farmer with access to a smartphone to enjoy expert knowledge in a practical and low-cost way.
Johannes et al. developed a system capable of identifying diseases in photos of wheat leaves obtained by smartphones. Picon et al. expands on this work using an adapted Deep Residual Neural Network-based algorithm to deal with the detection of multiple plant diseases from in-field acquired images.
Smartphone applications have been developed using deep learning methods. Elhassouny and Smarandache developed a smart mobile application using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to recognize tomato leaf diseases. Toseef and Khan developed a mobile app for diagnosis of crop diseases using a fuzzy inference system. Manso et al. developed a system for quantification and classifying of leaf miner and coffee leaf rust. The system uses a threshold-based method to quantify the severity and to identify each symptom individually. Marcos et al. and Boa Sorte et al. used deep leaning approach for coffee leaf disease detection, both of them using CNN based architectures. Only a few diseases were considered by these authors, Marcos et al. only dealt with rust and Boa Sorte et al. with rust and cercospora leaf spot. Other competitors in the market are: Plantix.net, Farmers Trend, Fiverr, Debo Engineering Corporate, and PlantVillage.
 
Why we are the number one choice Relatively high level of accuracy
Our proposed model achieved a testing accuracy of 99.08%, outperforming other classifiers. The results is due proper image preprocessing, data augmentation, and TensorFlow CNN provide an efficient classification method for identifying and classifying coffee diseases.
Wider range of disease detection
Our model is able to detect and classify four classes of conditions of coffee leaf namely rust, miner, phoma and healthy. Whereas most of our competitors most especially does doing it solely for deep learning research identify and classify two out of the four classes, mostly miner and rust.
Light weight
Our model makes use of the light-weight CNNs based on the TensorFlow deep learning framework. The result of this is that all smartphones are able to download, install, and use our App without troubles like crashing. Our competitors, on the other hand, used Yolov5, RESNET-based and GoogLeNet-based architectures since they are more concerned about the intellectual aspect of the technology. As a consequence, the computational requirements for using their applications became so profound that not all smartphone could bear the weight.
Speed and internet connectivity
Due to it light weight, our proposed model predicts and gives the results faster than our rivals in the market. It also works even in environments with low internet connectivity because of it light weight. The rival application due to their heavy weight architecture requires a strong internet connectivity for them to function properly.
Cross-platform
Our application would be built using Flutter so that it works on all smartphones, be it Android or iOS. This makes it ideal for farmers and other stakeholders to use our application without the need to buy a smartphone that our application is compatible with. Our rivals, however, developed their Apps using Android Studio and as a consequence their applications are only compatible with Android phones.
Holistic approach to the development process
Our rivals stops at detecting and classifying coffee leaf disease. We have decided to take a more holistic approach to the development of our application by not only detecting and classifying the leaf condition, but also to highlight the signs and symptoms and recommend the remedy for the disease that is predicted.
 
Demographics
In our research, we realized that most of the global coffee production are in Brazil, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Peru, India, China, et cetera. When you look at the data, you find that all the countries are Third-World countries. So the people we are targeting are coffee farmers in Third- world countries - the G-77 + China.


Added Innovation
Because our target is the under-developed world, we are trying to make the functioning of our model to be non-reliant on internet connectivity. This added innovation if successful will enable coffee farmers even in the remotest of environments to use our application without much of a hustle since internet is us
